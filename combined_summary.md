The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), project ID 139, was a satellite instrument designed to measure the state of Earth's troposphere (as detailed in the Wikipedia context).  This project, also identified as a FIELD SURVEYS platform (ID 139), utilized an imaging infrared Fourier-transform spectrometer (as described in "Tropospheric emission spectrometer for the Earth Observing System's Aura satellite", URL: https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-40-15-2356).  Its primary goal was to gather data on various atmospheric constituents,  including ozone, water vapor, and temperature.

This is evidenced by the existence of several datasets associated with TES: TES/Aura L3 Water Vapor Monthly Gridded V005 (ID 4005), TES/Aura L3 Atmospheric Temperature Monthly Gridded V006 (ID 4115), and TES/Aura L2 Formic Acid Nadir V007 (ID 4204). These datasets, presumably housed at a data center (ID 139, value N/A), provide crucial measurements that support scientific analysis.  The  retrieval methods and error analysis associated with TES data are further elaborated in "Tropospheric emission spectrometer: Retrieval method and error analysis" (URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1624609/).

The importance of TES's ozone measurements is highlighted by the Wikipedia context's discussion of ground-level (tropospheric) ozone â€“ a significant greenhouse gas and air pollutant.  The study "Comparisons of Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) ozone profiles to ozonesondes: Methods and initial results" (URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006JD007258) specifically addresses the comparison of TES ozone data with ground-based measurements, validating the instrument's capabilities.  The high-resolution, hourly data provided by a successor instrument, TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution), further underscores the ongoing need for precise tropospheric ozone monitoring.

While TES's primary focus wasn't directly methane emissions, its broader contribution to understanding atmospheric composition provides context for understanding the impact of greenhouse gases like methane, as discussed in the Wikipedia entry concerning increasing methane emissions and their contribution to global warming.  The publications associated with TES (IDs 4572, 3885, 3742) likely utilize TES data, but the provided abstracts don't directly link them to the instrument's ozone or other measurements.  Further investigation of the publications themselves would be required to fully assess their reliance on TES data and their specific contributions to our understanding of tropospheric processes.  The "CHANGE DETECTION SERVICES" ScienceKeyword (ID 139) suggests that TES data may also be used for detecting changes in atmospheric conditions over time.
