('Publication', 76606, 'abstract', 'Assessment of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is essential as it controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the atmosphere and land surface. ET also influences the available water resources and assists in the crop water assessment in agricultural areas. This study involves the assessment of spatial distribution of seasonal and annual ET using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and provides an estimation of future changes in ET due to land use and climate change for a portion of the Narmada river basin in Central India. Climate change effects on future ET are assessed using the ACCESS1-0 model of CMIP5. A Markov Chain model estimated future land use based on the probability of changes in the past. The ET analysis is carried out for the years 2009–2011. The results indicate variation in the seasonal ET with the changed land use. High ET is observed over forest areas and crop lands, but ET decreases over crop lands after harvest. The overall annual ET is high over water bodies and forest areas. ET is high in the premonsoon season over the water bodies and decreases in the winter. Future ET in the 2020s, 2030s, 2040s, and 2050s is shown with respect to land use and climate changes that project a gradual decrease due to the constant removal of the forest areas. The lowest ET is projected in 2050. Individual impact of land use change projects decreases in ET from 1990 to 2050, while climate change effect projects increases in ET in the future due to rises in temperature. However, the combined impacts of land use and climate changes indicate a decrease in ET in the future.')
('Publication', 94077, 'abstract', 'Yunnan province in China has rich forest resources but high forest fire frequency. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between climate change and forest fires in this region is important for forest fire prevention. This study used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) data to analyze the influence of climate change on forest fires in the region during 2003-2016. To improve the accuracy and reliability of GRACE TWSC data, we used the generalized three-cornered hat (GTCH) and the least square method to fuse TWSC data from six GRACE solutions. The spatiotemporal variation of forest fires during 2003-2016 was investigated using burned area data. Then, the relationship between burned area and hydrological and climatic factors was analyzed. The results indicate that more than 90% of burned areas are located in northwestern and southern Yunnan (NW and S). On the seasonal scale, forest fires are mainly concentrated in January-April (dry season) and the burned area is negatively correlated with precipitation (correlation coefficient r = -0.83 (NW) and -0.51 (S)), relative humidity (r = -0.79 (NW) and -0.92 (S)), GRACE TWSC (r = -0.57 (NW) and -0.73 (S)) and evapotranspiration (r = -0.90 (NW) and -0.35 (S)). However, the burned area has no significant correlations with the above four factors on the interannual scale. The composite analysis suggests that the extreme climate affects precipitation, evapotranspiration and TWSC in this region, thereby changing water storage of the air in this region, leading to the formation of an environment prone to forest fires. Such conditions have led to an increase in the burned area in the above region. We also found that the difference between TWSC in high- and low-fire years is much greater than the precipitation in the same period. The above results show that GRACE satellites can detect the influence of climate change on forest fires in Yunnan province.')
('Publication', 50763, 'abstract', "Global climate change is projected to raise global temperatures by 3.3-5.7 °C by 2100, resulting in changes in species composition, abundance, and nutritional quality of organisms at the base of the marine food web. Predicted increases in prey availability and reductions in prey nutritional quality under climate warming in certain marine systems are expected to impact higher trophic levels, such as fish and humans. There is limited knowledge of the interplay between food quantity and quality under warming, specifically when food availability is high, but quality is low. Here, we conducted an experiment assessing the effects of food quality (fatty acid composition and ratios) on juvenile Chinook salmon's (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) body and nutritional condition, specifically focusing on RNA:DNA ratio, Fulton's K, growth, mortality and their fatty acid composition. Experimental diets represented three different climate change scenarios with 1) a present-day diet (Euphausia pacifica), 2) a control diet (commercial aquaculture diet), and 3) a predicted Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) worst-case scenario diet with low essential fatty acid concentrations (IPCC SSP5-8.5). We tested how growth rates, RNA:DNA ratio, Fulton's K index, fatty acid composition and mortality rates in juvenile Chinook salmon compared across diet treatments. Fatty acids were incorporated into the salmon muscle at varying rates but, on average, reflected dietary concentrations. High dietary concentrations of DHA, EPA and high DHA:EPA ratios, under the control and present-day diets, increased fish growth and condition. In contrast, low concentrations of DHA and EPA and low DHA:EPA ratios in the diets under climate change scenario were not compensated for by increased food quantity. This result highlights the importance of considering food quality when assessing fish response to changing ocean conditions.")
('Publication', 55702, 'abstract', "The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels of experts that inform the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The EEAP focuses on the effects of UV radiation on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, and materials, as well as on the interactive effects of UV radiation and global climate change. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held. Because of the Montreal Protocol, there are now indications of the beginnings of a recovery of stratospheric ozone, although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain, particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa, are not yet fully understood. Some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of UV radiation, while other areas will likely experience a reduction in UV radiation as ozone- and climate-driven changes affect the amounts of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface.

('Publication', 88548, 'abstract', 'The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in the latest version of CNRM climate model, CNRM-CM6-1, and in its high-resolution counterpart, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, is significantly larger than in the previous version (CNRM-CM5.1). The traceability of this climate sensitivity change is investigated using coupled ocean-atmosphere model climate change simulations. These simulations show that the increase in ECS is the result of changes in the atmospheric component. A particular attention is paid to the method used to decompose the equilibrium temperature response difference, by using a linearized decomposition of the individual radiative agents diagnosed by a radiative kernel technique. The climate sensitivity increase is primarily due to the cloud radiative responses, with a predominant contribution of the tropical longwave response (including both feedback and forcing adjustment) and a significant contribution of the extratropical and tropical shortwave feedback changes. A series of stand-alone atmosphere experiments is carried out to quantify the contributions of each atmospheric development to this difference between CNRM-CM5.1 and CNRM-CM6-1. The change of the convection scheme appears to play an important role in driving the cloud changes, with a large effect on the tropical longwave cloud feedback change.')

Although the nexus between climate change and migration is not monolithic, analyses of individual-level factors at the local scale that reveal the specific drivers of migration are lacking. Here, we show that people are motivated by individual calculations, prioritizing economic and social factors when deciding to migrate. We use data from 53 structured interviews to decompose the assessment of the decision-making process of people deciding to migrate from a region highly vulnerable to climate change, assessing the internal and external migratory potential. The assessment of migration potential evidenced that potential migrants react and make decisions based on perceptions and preferences among economic, social, environmental, and cultural factors when migrating and value these factors differently. Our spatial multi-criteria model reports disaggregation in that people prioritize economic factors, such as unemployment, job opportunities, and lack of income, over other migration-related factors, while environmental factors are generally considered underlying. Our results demonstrate that migration is not monolithic but a mixture and amalgam of multiple interacting factors, which causes people to migrate or stay in one place despite vulnerability and climate change impacts.')

An integrated vertical hydrological model, assuming negligible horizontal subsurface flows, employed the Dunay-Varga-Haszonits methodology for evaporation and Kovács approach for the water retention curve. Verified with two meteorological databases, the model was accepted for 463 wells based on NSE &gt; 0.4 and RMSE &lt; 0.5 m criteria. The FORESEE HUN v1.0 dataset proved suitable after spatial consistency tests. Examining 28 bias- and discontinuity-corrected climate model projections on these wells revealed a general decline in the groundwater table. Differences between trends to 2050 and 2100 suggested lower groundwater levels by mid-century. This research highlights climate change impacts in a crucial Central-European agricultural region in the Carpathian Basin and emphasizes the importance of modeling climate change-induced changes in shallow groundwater levels in water resources management.")
('Publication', 12919, 'abstract', 'The implementation of adaptation strategies of agriculture and forestry to climate change is conditioned by the knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the vegetation cycle and of the associated uncertainties. Using the same generic Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate the response of various vegetation types is more straightforward than using several specialized crop and forestry models, as model implementation differences are difficult to assess. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of a LSM to address this issue. Using the SURFEX ("Surface Externalisée") modeling platform, we produced and analyzed 150-yr (1950-2100) simulations of the biomass of four vegetation types (rainfed straw cereals, rainfed grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests) and of the soil water content associated to each of these vegetation types over France. Statistical methods were used to quantify the impact of climate change on simulated phenological dates. The duration of soil moisture stress periods increases everywhere in France, especially for grasslands with, on average, an increase of 9 days per year in near-future (NF) conditions and 36 days per year in distant-future (DF) conditions. For all the vegetation types, leaf onset and the annual maximum LAI occur earlier. For straw cereals in the Languedoc-Provence-Corsica area, NF leaf onset occurs 18 days earlier and 37 days earlier in DF conditions, on average. On the other hand, local discrepancies are simulated for the senescence period (e.g. earlier in western and southern France for broadleaf forests, slightly later in mountainous areas of eastern France) for both NF and DF. Changes in phenological dates are more uncertain in DF than in NF conditions in relation to differences in climate models, especially for forests. Finally, it is shown that while changes in leaf onset are mainly driven by air temperature, longer soil moisture stress periods trigger earlier leaf senescence over most of France. This shows that developing in situ soil moisture networks could help monitoring the long-term impacts of climate change.')
('Publication', 60848, 'abstract', 'Climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment. Moreover, previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles. This study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in Ganjiang River basin, China. The outputs of two global climate models (BNU-ESM and BCC-CSM1.1) are statistically downscaled by Daily bias correction (DBC) method and used as inputs of the Xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966-2099. Projections for future flood (2020-2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are divided into two 40-year horizons (2040s, 2080s) and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline (1966-2005). Univariate flood frequency analysis indicates that there is a considerable increase in the magnitude and frequency of flood under the RCP8.5 scenario, especially for the higher return periods. The bivariate quantile curves under different levels of Joint Return Period (JRP) for historical and future periods are derived by copula functions and the most likely realizations are estimated. It is found that climate change has heavier impacts on the future joint bivariate quantiles for larger return periods. Finally the adaptive isolines and most likely flood quantiles under a JRP are derived from analyzing the merged series by non-stationary copula-based models. The results highlight that the joint probability, illustrated by the isoline of a given JRP, varies significantly over time when non-stationary models are applied. This study incorporates the impacts of climate change on bivariate flood quantiles and develops an adaptive quantile estimation approach, which may provide useful information for the references of flood risk assessment and management under changing environment.')
('Publication', 35890, 'abstract', 'Agricultural practices that both support climate change mitigation and facilitate adaptation to a changing climate are critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring food security. This need has led to many claims regarding the potential for a variety of agricultural practices to achieve synergies between mitigation and adaptation in agriculture. However, the evidence for climate change mitigation and adaptation synergies in agriculture remains mixed. To evaluate such claims, we examined the evidence for these synergies by conducting a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature that make claims about outcomes for both climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture. Based on 87 articles identified, we show that synergistic outcomes are claimed more frequently than tradeoffs for all practices, yet the evidence was stronger for mixed and conflicting outcomes than for synergies. Indeed, claims of synergistic outcomes may be overstated, because these publications more often relied on secondary data rather than empirically evaluating adaptation and mitigation outcomes. We also show important gaps in the consideration and assessment of climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives and outcomes. This review highlights the critical need for more robust research, evidence, and evaluation of the adaptation and mitigation outcomes of agricultural practices, and the need to clarify the contexts of such results, in order to effectively support policies and practices that aim to promote synergistic outcomes and avoid conflicting outcomes.')

Tropospheric ozone is also significant for its impact on climate as a greenhouse gas. Operating since 2011, TOLNet is an interagency collaboration between NASA, NOAA, and the EPA designed to perform studies of air quality and atmospheric modeling as well as validation and interpretation of satellite observations. TOLNet is currently comprised of six Differential Absorption Lidars (DIAL). Each of the lidars are unique, and some have had a long history of ozone observations prior to joining the network. Five lidars are mobile systems that can be deployed at remote locations to support field campaigns. This includes the Langley Mobile Ozone Lidar (LMOL) at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), the Tropospheric Ozone (TROPOZ) lidar at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), the Tunable Optical Profile for Aerosol and oZone (TOPAZ) lidar at the NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory (CSL) in Boulder, Colorado, the Autonomous Mobile Ozone LIDAR instrument for Tropospheric Experiments (AMOLITE) lidar at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in Toronto, Canada, and the Rocket-city O3 Quality Evaluation in the Troposphere (RO3QET) lidar at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Alabama. \r\nThe remaining lidars, the Table Mountain Facility (TMF) tropospheric ozone lidar system located at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and City College of New York (CCNY) New York Tropospheric Ozone Lidar System (NYTOLS) are fixed systems.\r\n\r\nTOLNet seeks to address three science objectives. The primary objective of the network is to provide high spatio-temporal measurements of ozone from near the surface to the top of the troposphere. Detailed observations of ozone structure allow science teams and the modeling community to better understand ozone in the lower-atmosphere and to assess the accuracy and vertical resolution with which geosynchronous instruments could retrieve the observed laminar ozone structures. Another objective of TOLNet is to identify an ozone lidar instrument design that would be suitable to address the needs of NASA, NOAA, and EPA air quality scientists who express a desire for these ozone profiles. The third objective of TOLNET is to perform basic scientific research into the processes create and destroy the ubiquitously observed ozone laminae and other ozone features in the troposphere. To help fulfill these objectives, lidars that are a part of TOLNet have been deployed to support nearly ten campaigns thus far. This includes campaigns such as the Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) mission, the Korea United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ), the Tracking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment – Air Quality (TRACER-AQ) campaign, the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ), the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS), and the Ozone Water–Land Environmental Transition Study (OWLETS).')
