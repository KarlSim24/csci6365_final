ID: 60848, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment. Moreover, previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles. This study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in Ganjiang River basin, China. The outputs of two global climate models (BNU-ESM and BCC-CSM1.1) are statistically downscaled by Daily bias correction (DBC) method and used as inputs of the Xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966-2099. Projections for future flood (2020-2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are divided into two 40-year horizons (2040s, 2080s) and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline (1966-2005). Univariate f...
ID: 82757, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: The 2022 drought highlighted Hungary's vulnerability to climate change, especially the Great Hungarian Plain. Soil moisture, which is crucial for agriculture, depends on the position of the shallow groundwater table. This study investigated the effects of climate change on groundwater table fluctuations in more than 500 wells on the plain. An integrated vertical hydrological model, assuming negligible horizontal subsurface flows, employed the Dunay-Varga-Haszonits methodology for evaporation and Kovács approach for the water retention curve. Verified with two meteorological databases, the model was accepted for 463 wells based on NSE &gt; 0.4 and RMSE &lt; 0.5 m criteria. The FORESEE HUN v1.0 dataset proved suitable after spatial consistency tests. Examining 28 bias- and discontinuity-corrected climate model projections on these wells revealed a general decline in the groundwater table. Differences between trends to 2050 and 2100 suggested lower groundwater levels by mid-century. This ...
ID: 42689, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Climate change impacts on populations have increased the number of affected people and climate migrants worldwide. Although the nexus between climate change and migration is not monolithic, analyses of individual-level factors at the local scale that reveal the specific drivers of migration are lacking. Here, we show that people are motivated by individual calculations, prioritizing economic and social factors when deciding to migrate. We use data from 53 structured interviews to decompose the assessment of the decision-making process of people deciding to migrate from a region highly vulnerable to climate change, assessing the internal and external migratory potential. The assessment of migration potential evidenced that potential migrants react and make decisions based on perceptions and preferences among economic, social, environmental, and cultural factors when migrating and value these factors differently. Our spatial multi-criteria model reports disaggregation in that people prio...
ID: 61, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: The Multi-Source Land Surface Phenology (LSP) Yearly North America 30 meter (m) Version 1.1 product (MSLSP) provides a Land Surface Phenology product for North America derived from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data. Data from the combined Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A and 2B Multispectral Instrument (MSI) provides the user community with dates of phenophase transitions, including the timing of greenup, maturity, senescence, and dormancy at 30m spatial resolution. These data sets are useful for a wide range of applications, including ecosystem and agro-ecosystem modeling, monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate variability and extreme events, crop-type discrimination, and land cover, land use, and land cover change mapping. 

Provided in the MSLSP product are layers for percent greenness, onset greenness dates, Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI2) amplitude, and maximum EVI2, and data quality information for up to two phenological cycl...
ID: 97, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: Goddard’s LiDAR, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Imager (G-LiHT(https://gliht.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) mission utilizes a portable, airborne imaging system that aims to simultaneously map the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial ecosystems. G-LiHT primarily focuses on a broad diversity of forest communities and ecoregions in North America, mapping aerial swaths over the Conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.

The purpose of G-LiHT’s Canopy Height Model data product (GLCHMT) is to provide LiDAR-derived maximum canopy height and canopy variability information to aid in the study and analysis of biodiversity and climate change. Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center began collecting data over locally-defined areas in 2011 and that the collection will continue to grow as aerial campaigns are flown and processed.

GLCHMT data are processed as a raster data product (GeoTIFF) at a nominal 1 meter spatial resolution over locally-defined areas. A lo...
ID: 4180, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: CAL_LID_L2_05kmCLay-Standard-V4-21 is the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Lidar Level 2 5 km Cloud Layer, Version 4-21 data product. Data for this product was collected using the CALIPSO Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument. The version of this product was changed from 4-20 to 4-21 to account for a change in the operating system of the CALIPSO production cluster. Data collection for this product is ongoing.

CALIPSO was launched on April 28, 2006, to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments: CALIOP, Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales).
