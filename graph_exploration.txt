ID: 60848, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment. Moreover, previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles. This study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in Ganjiang River basin, China. The outputs of two global climate models (BNU-ESM and BCC-CSM1.1) are statistically downscaled by Daily bias correction (DBC) method and used as inputs of the Xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966-2099. Projections for future flood (2020-2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are divided into two 40-year horizons (2040s, 2080s) and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline (1966-2005). Univariate f...
ID: 76606, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Assessment of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is essential as it controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the atmosphere and land surface. ET also influences the available water resources and assists in the crop water assessment in agricultural areas. This study involves the assessment of spatial distribution of seasonal and annual ET using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and provides an estimation of future changes in ET due to land use and climate change for a portion of the Narmada river basin in Central India. Climate change effects on future ET are assessed using the ACCESS1-0 model of CMIP5. A Markov Chain model estimated future land use based on the probability of changes in the past. The ET analysis is carried out for the years 2009–2011. The results indicate variation in the seasonal ET with the changed land use. High ET is observed over forest areas and crop lands, but ET decreases over crop lands after harvest. The overall annual ET is high ove...
ID: 42689, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Climate change impacts on populations have increased the number of affected people and climate migrants worldwide. Although the nexus between climate change and migration is not monolithic, analyses of individual-level factors at the local scale that reveal the specific drivers of migration are lacking. Here, we show that people are motivated by individual calculations, prioritizing economic and social factors when deciding to migrate. We use data from 53 structured interviews to decompose the assessment of the decision-making process of people deciding to migrate from a region highly vulnerable to climate change, assessing the internal and external migratory potential. The assessment of migration potential evidenced that potential migrants react and make decisions based on perceptions and preferences among economic, social, environmental, and cultural factors when migrating and value these factors differently. Our spatial multi-criteria model reports disaggregation in that people prio...
ID: 3752, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: CAL_LID_L3_Tropospheric_APro_CloudySkyOpaque-Standard-V4-20 is the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Lidar Level 3 Tropospheric Aerosol Profiles, Cloudy Sky Opaque Data, Standard Version 4-20 data product. This data product was collected using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument. Data generation and distribution of this V4.20 product ended on July 1, 2020, to support a change in the operating system of the CALIPSO production clusters. The V4.21 data product covers July 1, 2020, to current. 

The CALIPSO lidar level 3 aerosol data product reports monthly mean profiles of aerosol optical properties on a uniform spatial grid. It is intended to be a tropospheric product, so data are only reported below altitudes of 12km. All level 3 parameters are derived from the version 4.20 CALIOP level 2 aerosol profile product and have been quality screened before averaging. The primary quantities reported are vertical pr...
ID: 4253, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: CAL_LID_L2_05kmMLay-Standard-V4-21 is the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Lidar Level 2 5 km Merged Layer, Version 4-21 data product. Data for this product was collected using the CALIPSO Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument. The version of this product was changed from 4-20 to 4-21 to account for a change in the operating system of the CALIPSO production cluster. 

CALIPSO was launched on April 28, 2006, to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments: CALIOP, Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales).
ID: 4329, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: TOLNet_ECCC_Data is the lidar data collected by the Autonomous Mobile Ozone LIDAR instrument for Tropospheric Experiments (AMOLITE) lidar at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in Toronto, Canada as part of the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet). Data collection for this product is ongoing.

In the troposphere, ozone is considered a pollutant and is important to understand due to its harmful effects on human health and vegetation. Tropospheric ozone is also significant for its impact on climate as a greenhouse gas. Operating since 2011, TOLNet is an interagency collaboration between NASA, NOAA, and the EPA designed to perform studies of air quality and atmospheric modeling as well as validation and interpretation of satellite observations. TOLNet is currently comprised of six Differential Absorption Lidars (DIAL). Each of the lidars are unique, and some have had a long history of ozone observations prior to joining the network. Five lidars are mobile systems that can ...
