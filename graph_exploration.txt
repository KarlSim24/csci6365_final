ID: 88548, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in the latest version of CNRM climate model, CNRM-CM6-1, and in its high-resolution counterpart, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, is significantly larger than in the previous version (CNRM-CM5.1). The traceability of this climate sensitivity change is investigated using coupled ocean-atmosphere model climate change simulations. These simulations show that the increase in ECS is the result of changes in the atmospheric component. A particular attention is paid to the method used to decompose the equilibrium temperature response difference, by using a linearized decomposition of the individual radiative agents diagnosed by a radiative kernel technique. The climate sensitivity increase is primarily due to the cloud radiative responses, with a predominant contribution of the tropical longwave response (including both feedback and forcing adjustment) and a significant contribution of the extratropical and tropical shortwave feedback changes. A series of stand-alone a...
ID: 12919, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: The implementation of adaptation strategies of agriculture and forestry to climate change is conditioned by the knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the vegetation cycle and of the associated uncertainties. Using the same generic Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate the response of various vegetation types is more straightforward than using several specialized crop and forestry models, as model implementation differences are difficult to assess. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of a LSM to address this issue. Using the SURFEX ("Surface Externalisée") modeling platform, we produced and analyzed 150-yr (1950-2100) simulations of the biomass of four vegetation types (rainfed straw cereals, rainfed grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests) and of the soil water content associated to each of these vegetation types over France. Statistical methods were used to quantify the impact of climate change on simulated phenological dates. The duration of soil m...
ID: 60848, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment. Moreover, previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles. This study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in Ganjiang River basin, China. The outputs of two global climate models (BNU-ESM and BCC-CSM1.1) are statistically downscaled by Daily bias correction (DBC) method and used as inputs of the Xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966-2099. Projections for future flood (2020-2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are divided into two 40-year horizons (2040s, 2080s) and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline (1966-2005). Univariate f...
ID: 2323, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.

An overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document....
ID: 4253, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: CAL_LID_L2_05kmMLay-Standard-V4-21 is the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Lidar Level 2 5 km Merged Layer, Version 4-21 data product. Data for this product was collected using the CALIPSO Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument. The version of this product was changed from 4-20 to 4-21 to account for a change in the operating system of the CALIPSO production cluster. 

CALIPSO was launched on April 28, 2006, to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. It flies in the international A-Train constellation for coincident Earth observations. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments: CALIOP, Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR), and Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales).
ID: 65, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: The NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/community/community-data-system-programs/measures-projects) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) Version 1 data product (VCF5KYR) provides global fractional vegetation cover at 0.05 degree (5,600 meter) spatial resolution at yearly intervals from 1982 to 2016. The VCF5KYR data product is derived from a bagged linear model algorithm using Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR V4) data compiled from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is the ratio of the area of the vertical projection of green vegetation above ground to the total area, capturing the horizontal distribution and density of vegetation on the Earth’s surface. FVC is a primary means for measuring global forest cover change and is a key parameter for a variety of environmental and climate-related applications, including carbon land surface models and bioma...
