ID: 88548, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in the latest version of CNRM climate model, CNRM-CM6-1, and in its high-resolution counterpart, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, is significantly larger than in the previous version (CNRM-CM5.1). The traceability of this climate sensitivity change is investigated using coupled ocean-atmosphere model climate change simulations. These simulations show that the increase in ECS is the result of changes in the atmospheric component. A particular attention is paid to the method used to decompose the equilibrium temperature response difference, by using a linearized decomposition of the individual radiative agents diagnosed by a radiative kernel technique. The climate sensitivity increase is primarily due to the cloud radiative responses, with a predominant contribution of the tropical longwave response (including both feedback and forcing adjustment) and a significant contribution of the extratropical and tropical shortwave feedback changes. A series of stand-alone a...
ID: 35890, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Agricultural practices that both support climate change mitigation and facilitate adaptation to a changing climate are critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring food security. This need has led to many claims regarding the potential for a variety of agricultural practices to achieve synergies between mitigation and adaptation in agriculture. However, the evidence for climate change mitigation and adaptation synergies in agriculture remains mixed. To evaluate such claims, we examined the evidence for these synergies by conducting a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature that make claims about outcomes for both climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture. Based on 87 articles identified, we show that synergistic outcomes are claimed more frequently than tradeoffs for all practices, yet the evidence was stronger for mixed and conflicting outcomes than for synergies. Indeed, claims of synergistic outcomes may be overstated, because these publications ...
ID: 76606, Type: Publication, Key: abstract, Value: Assessment of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is essential as it controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the atmosphere and land surface. ET also influences the available water resources and assists in the crop water assessment in agricultural areas. This study involves the assessment of spatial distribution of seasonal and annual ET using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and provides an estimation of future changes in ET due to land use and climate change for a portion of the Narmada river basin in Central India. Climate change effects on future ET are assessed using the ACCESS1-0 model of CMIP5. A Markov Chain model estimated future land use based on the probability of changes in the past. The ET analysis is carried out for the years 2009–2011. The results indicate variation in the seasonal ET with the changed land use. High ET is observed over forest areas and crop lands, but ET decreases over crop lands after harvest. The overall annual ET is high ove...
ID: 2323, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.

An overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document....
ID: 293, Type: Dataset, Key: abstract, Value: Goddard’s LiDAR, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Imager (G-LiHT(https://gliht.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) mission utilizes a portable, airborne imaging system that aims to simultaneously map the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial ecosystems. G-LiHT primarily focuses on a broad diversity of forest communities and ecoregions in North America, mapping aerial swaths over the Conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.

The purpose of G-LiHT’s Canopy Height Model Keyhole Markup Language (KML) data product (GLCHMK) is to provide LiDAR-derived maximum canopy height and canopy variability information to aid in the study and analysis of biodiversity and climate change. Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center began collecting data over locally-defined areas in 2011 and that the collection will continue to grow as aerial campaigns are flown and processed.
