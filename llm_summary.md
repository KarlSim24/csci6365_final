The provided text focuses on various research studies examining the impacts of climate change and its effects on different aspects of the environment and human society.  Several studies analyze the effects of climate change on:

* **Evapotranspiration (ET):**  Research investigates spatial and temporal variations in ET across different land use types (forests, croplands) and projects future changes based on climate and land use modeling.
* **Forest fires:** One study uses GRACE satellite data to analyze the relationship between climate change and forest fire frequency in Yunnan, China.
* **Marine ecosystems:** An experiment assesses the impact of climate change-induced changes in prey nutritional quality on juvenile Chinook salmon.
* **Stratospheric ozone and UV radiation:**  The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel's work is highlighted, focusing on the complex interplay between stratospheric ozone recovery (due to the Montreal Protocol) and climate change, and their combined effects on UV radiation levels.
* **Climate model sensitivity:** A study investigates the increased equilibrium climate sensitivity in a specific climate model (CNRM-CM6-1) and attributes it to changes in atmospheric components, particularly cloud radiative responses.
* **Human migration:** Research explores the individual-level factors influencing migration decisions in regions highly vulnerable to climate change, emphasizing the interplay of economic, social, and environmental considerations.
* **Groundwater levels:**  A study examines the impact of climate change on groundwater table fluctuations in Hungary's Great Hungarian Plain, using hydrological modeling and climate projections.
* **Vegetation cycles and agricultural adaptation:**  Research explores the potential of a Land Surface Model to simulate the impacts of climate change on vegetation and soil water content, informing adaptation strategies for agriculture and forestry.
* **Flood frequency and design floods:** A study investigates the impact of climate change on the bivariate characteristics of flood peak and volume, using climate model outputs and a hydrological model.
* **Agricultural practices:** A systematic review assesses the evidence for synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation in various agricultural practices, finding that claims of synergies may be overstated.


The Wikipedia context provides background information on climate change, its denial, mitigation and effects, and the role of the UNFCCC in international efforts to address it.  Overall, the search results and Wikipedia context paint a picture of the multifaceted nature of climate change, its impacts across various systems, and the ongoing scientific efforts to understand and address it.
