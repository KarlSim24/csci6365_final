- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: Assessment of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is essential as it controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the atmosphere and land surface. ET also influences the available water resources and assists in the crop water assessment in agricultural areas. This study involves the assessment of spatial distribution of seasonal and annual ET using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and provides an estimation of future changes in ET due to land use and climate change for a portion of the Narmada river basin in Central India. Climate change effects on future ET are assessed using the ACCESS1-0 model of CMIP5. A Markov Chain model estimated future land use based on the probability of changes in the past. The ET analysis is carried out for the years 2009–2011. The results indicate variation in the seasonal ET with the changed land use. High ET is observed over forest areas and crop lands, but ET decreases over crop lands after harvest. The overall annual ET is high ove...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: Yunnan province in China has rich forest resources but high forest fire frequency. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between climate change and forest fires in this region is important for forest fire prevention. This study used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) data to analyze the influence of climate change on forest fires in the region during 2003-2016. To improve the accuracy and reliability of GRACE TWSC data, we used the generalized three-cornered hat (GTCH) and the least square method to fuse TWSC data from six GRACE solutions. The spatiotemporal variation of forest fires during 2003-2016 was investigated using burned area data. Then, the relationship between burned area and hydrological and climatic factors was analyzed. The results indicate that more than 90% of burned areas are located in northwestern and southern Yunnan (NW and S). On the seasonal scale, forest fires are mainly concentrated in Janu...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: Global climate change is projected to raise global temperatures by 3.3-5.7 °C by 2100, resulting in changes in species composition, abundance, and nutritional quality of organisms at the base of the marine food web. Predicted increases in prey availability and reductions in prey nutritional quality under climate warming in certain marine systems are expected to impact higher trophic levels, such as fish and humans. There is limited knowledge of the interplay between food quantity and quality under warming, specifically when food availability is high, but quality is low. Here, we conducted an experiment assessing the effects of food quality (fatty acid composition and ratios) on juvenile Chinook salmon's (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) body and nutritional condition, specifically focusing on RNA:DNA ratio, Fulton's K, growth, mortality and their fatty acid composition. Experimental diets represented three different climate change scenarios with 1) a present-day diet (Euphausia pacifica), 2) ...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels of experts that inform the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The EEAP focuses on the effects of UV radiation on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, and materials, as well as on the interactive effects of UV radiation and global climate change. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held. Because of the Montreal Protocol, there are now indications of the beginnings of a recovery of stratospheric ozone, although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain, particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa, are not yet fully understood. Some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of UV radiation, while other areas will likely experience a reduction in UV radiation as ozone- and climate-driven chan...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in the latest version of CNRM climate model, CNRM-CM6-1, and in its high-resolution counterpart, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, is significantly larger than in the previous version (CNRM-CM5.1). The traceability of this climate sensitivity change is investigated using coupled ocean-atmosphere model climate change simulations. These simulations show that the increase in ECS is the result of changes in the atmospheric component. A particular attention is paid to the method used to decompose the equilibrium temperature response difference, by using a linearized decomposition of the individual radiative agents diagnosed by a radiative kernel technique. The climate sensitivity increase is primarily due to the cloud radiative responses, with a predominant contribution of the tropical longwave response (including both feedback and forcing adjustment) and a significant contribution of the extratropical and tropical shortwave feedback changes. A series of stand-alone a...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: Climate change impacts on populations have increased the number of affected people and climate migrants worldwide. Although the nexus between climate change and migration is not monolithic, analyses of individual-level factors at the local scale that reveal the specific drivers of migration are lacking. Here, we show that people are motivated by individual calculations, prioritizing economic and social factors when deciding to migrate. We use data from 53 structured interviews to decompose the assessment of the decision-making process of people deciding to migrate from a region highly vulnerable to climate change, assessing the internal and external migratory potential. The assessment of migration potential evidenced that potential migrants react and make decisions based on perceptions and preferences among economic, social, environmental, and cultural factors when migrating and value these factors differently. Our spatial multi-criteria model reports disaggregation in that people prio...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: The 2022 drought highlighted Hungary's vulnerability to climate change, especially the Great Hungarian Plain. Soil moisture, which is crucial for agriculture, depends on the position of the shallow groundwater table. This study investigated the effects of climate change on groundwater table fluctuations in more than 500 wells on the plain. An integrated vertical hydrological model, assuming negligible horizontal subsurface flows, employed the Dunay-Varga-Haszonits methodology for evaporation and Kovács approach for the water retention curve. Verified with two meteorological databases, the model was accepted for 463 wells based on NSE &gt; 0.4 and RMSE &lt; 0.5 m criteria. The FORESEE HUN v1.0 dataset proved suitable after spatial consistency tests. Examining 28 bias- and discontinuity-corrected climate model projections on these wells revealed a general decline in the groundwater table. Differences between trends to 2050 and 2100 suggested lower groundwater levels by mid-century. This ...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: The implementation of adaptation strategies of agriculture and forestry to climate change is conditioned by the knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the vegetation cycle and of the associated uncertainties. Using the same generic Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate the response of various vegetation types is more straightforward than using several specialized crop and forestry models, as model implementation differences are difficult to assess. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of a LSM to address this issue. Using the SURFEX ("Surface Externalisée") modeling platform, we produced and analyzed 150-yr (1950-2100) simulations of the biomass of four vegetation types (rainfed straw cereals, rainfed grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests) and of the soil water content associated to each of these vegetation types over France. Statistical methods were used to quantify the impact of climate change on simulated phenological dates. The duration of soil m...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: Climate change will lead to great impacts on flood frequency curve and design floods in the future. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to analyze the flood characteristics within a bivariate framework under changing environment. Moreover, previous studies investigating bivariate characteristics of flood usually do not derive the adaptive flood quantiles. This study assesses the implications of climate change for future bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume in Ganjiang River basin, China. The outputs of two global climate models (BNU-ESM and BCC-CSM1.1) are statistically downscaled by Daily bias correction (DBC) method and used as inputs of the Xinanjiang hydrological model to simulate streamflow during 1966-2099. Projections for future flood (2020-2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are divided into two 40-year horizons (2040s, 2080s) and a comparison is made between these time horizons and the baseline (1966-2005). Univariate f...
- Node Type: Publication, Property: abstract, Value: Agricultural practices that both support climate change mitigation and facilitate adaptation to a changing climate are critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring food security. This need has led to many claims regarding the potential for a variety of agricultural practices to achieve synergies between mitigation and adaptation in agriculture. However, the evidence for climate change mitigation and adaptation synergies in agriculture remains mixed. To evaluate such claims, we examined the evidence for these synergies by conducting a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature that make claims about outcomes for both climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture. Based on 87 articles identified, we show that synergistic outcomes are claimed more frequently than tradeoffs for all practices, yet the evidence was stronger for mixed and conflicting outcomes than for synergies. Indeed, claims of synergistic outcomes may be overstated, because these publications ...

1. Title: Climate change
   Summary: Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels not seen for millions of years....
2. Title: Climate change denial
   Summary: Climate change denial is a form of science denial characterized by rejecting, refusing to acknowledge, disputing, or fighting the scientific consensus on climate change. Those promoting denial commonly use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of a scientific controversy where there is none. Climate change denial includes unreasonable doubts about the extent to which climate change is caused by humans, its effects on nature and human society, and the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions. To a lesser extent, climate change denial can also be implicit when people accept the science but fail to reconcile it with their belief or action. Several studies have analyzed these positions as forms of denialism, pseudoscience, or propaganda....
3. Title: Climate change mitigation
   Summary: Climate change mitigation (or decarbonisation) is action to limit the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause climate change. Climate change mitigation actions include conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Current climate change mitigation policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about 2.7 °C by 2100, significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to below 2 °C....
4. Title: Effects of climate change
   Summary: Effects of climate change are well documented and growing for Earth's natural environment and human societies. Changes to the climate system include an overall warming trend, changes to precipitation patterns, and more extreme weather. As the climate changes it impacts the natural environment with effects such as more intense forest fires, thawing permafrost, and desertification. These changes impact ecosystems and societies, and can become irreversible once tipping points are crossed. Climate activists are engaged in a range of activities around the world that seek to ameliorate these issues or prevent them from happening....
5. Title: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   Summary: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the UN process for negotiating an agreement to limit dangerous climate change. It is an international treaty among countries to combat "dangerous human interference with the climate system". The main way to do this is limiting the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It was signed in 1992 by 154 states at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), informally known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro. The treaty entered into force on 21 March 1994. "UNFCCC" is also the name of the Secretariat charged with supporting the operation of the convention, with offices on the UN Campus in Bonn, Germany....
